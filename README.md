Email Blueprints
================
Email Blueprints is a collection of HTML email templates that can serve as a solid foundation and starting point for the design of emails. They include template language elements that make them customizable when imported into a MailChimp account, as well as merge tags that will generate dynamic content when sent through MailChimp. Not a MailChimp user? You can [sign up free](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup) or simply strip out merge tags and use these templates to send through any system.
